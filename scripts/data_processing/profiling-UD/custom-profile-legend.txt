>>> Raw Text Properties:

[n_tokens]: total number of tokens


>>> Morphosyntactic information:

[lexical_density]: the value corresponds to the ratio between content words (nouns, proper nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) over the total number of words in a document

>>> Syntactic features:

Verbal Predicate Structure:

[verbal_head_per_sent]: average distribution of verbal heads in the document, out ot the total of heads. 

[avg_verb_edges]: verbal arity, calculated as the average number of instantiated dependency links (covering both arguments and modifiers) sharing the same verbal head, excluding punctuation and auxiliaries bearing the syntactic role of copula according to the UD scheme

Global and Local Parsed Tree Structures:

[avg_max_depth]: mean of the maximum tree depths extracted from each sentence of a document. The maximum depth is calculated as the longest path (in terms of occurring dependency links) from the root of the dependency tree to some leaf.

[avg_links_len]: average number of words occurring linearly between each syntactic head and its dependent (excluding punctuation dependencies).

Use of Subordination:

[subordinate_proposition_dist]: distribution of subordinate clauses, as defined in the UD scheme: https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/complex-syntax.html#subordination.

[avg_subordinate_chain_len]: average length of subordinate chains, where a subordinate 'chain' is calculated as the number of subordinate clauses embedded on a first subordinate clause.
